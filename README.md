# The AAS WorldWide Telescope WebGL engine

The “WebGL engine” of the [AAS](https://aas.org/)
[WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) is the
JavaScript library that powers the Web-based versions of the WWT visualization
software, as exemplified by the
[WWT web client](http://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient).

WWT is a free, open-source tool for visually exploring humanity’s scientific
understanding of the Universe. The web client is the primary portal by which
people interact with WWT — allowing interactive exploration of terabytes of
astronomical data in a seamlessly integrated 4D simulation of the known
universe. However, the WWT software ecosystem also includes a Windows
application that can power planetariums (see [wwt-windows-client]), a
cloud-based web service for discovering and sharing astronomical data (see
[wwt-website]), and [pywwt], a Python module allowing users to write their own
software to control and extend all of these systems.

WWT is brought to you by the non-profit [American Astronomical Society] (AAS)
and the [.NET Foundation]. Established in 1899 and based in Washington, DC,
the AAS is the major organization of professional astronomers in North
America.

## Getting involved

We love it when people get involved in the WWT community! You can get started
by [participating in our user forum] or by
[signing up for our low-traffic newsletter]. If you would like to help make
WWT better, our [Contributor Hub] aims to be your one-stop shop for
information about how to contribute to the project, with the
[Contributors’ Guide] being the first thing you should read. Here on GitHub we
operate with a standard [fork-and-pull] model.
