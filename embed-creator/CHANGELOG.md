# rc: micro bump

- No code changes, just making Cranko happy.


# @wwtelescope/embed-creator 0.3.0 (2020-10-09)

- Add permissions in the recommended embed `<iframe>` HTML. This will allow
  embeds to fullscreen. We also request some additional permissions that aren't
  used now, but that we might wish to use in the future.


#  @wwtelescope/embed-creator 0.2.1 (2020-09-24)

- No code changes; just issuing a new release for the Cranko switchover.
