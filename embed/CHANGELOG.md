# @wwtelescope/embed 1.4.0 (2020-12-30)

- Large amounts of UI polish for tour playback. We now have UI controls, fixes
  for mobile, and a "letterbox" mode that ensures that the aspect ratio of the
  WWT canvas is reasonable when playing back tours.


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.3.0 (2020-10-09)

- Add new UI "controls" (to be distinguished from the "tools"): zoom buttons and
  a fullscreen toggle. Woo!


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.2.1 (2020-09-24)

- No code changes; just issuing a new release for the Cranko conversion.
