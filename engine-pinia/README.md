# @wwtelescope/engine-vuex

The [@wwtelescope/engine-vuex] package wraps the core rendering engine of the
[AAS] [WorldWide Telescope][wwt-home] (WWT) stack ([@wwtelescope/engine]) into a
plugin for the [Vuex] state management library. It is the basis for WWT-powered
web apps such as [the WWT emebd][@wwtelescope/embed] and [the WWT Embed Creator
UI][@wwtelescope/embed-creator]. Learn more about WWT [here][wwt-home].
