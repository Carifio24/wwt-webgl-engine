# rc: minor bump

First release of the new "research application". This will be the embeddable UI
for use in Jupyter, reseacher-oriented interfaces, etc.

This version can handle all of the messages from the pywwt "JSON API", which
means that it can be dropped in as a replacement for the pywwt widget with the
proper JupyterLab glue, as implemented in what is currently called the
`wwt-research-kit` repo.
